# hello-world
My first repository on github, can't wait to see what's ahead. 


My name is Theo Dowglass and I'm really keen to pursue a career in computer science.
I understand that computer science is an incredibly broad term with so many different passions which can be followed within, at the moment I really interested in following Machine Learning and Cyber security (although I find the psychology behind web design to be fascinating and feel learning about human computer interaction is vital knowledge to building truly helpful programs)

I'm about to start a degree at Durham university. I'm excited however I'm worried that I don't have enough programming experience so to accompany my studies I am going to be creating small little projects exploring the different paths of computer science to broaden my horizons. 


I want to use my career within computer science to help create projects which are going to help reinforce trust between computer and user. To create projects which are able to safely use data in order to make the digital world accesible for everyone without comprimising privacy. 



All the best, Theo from 2021.
